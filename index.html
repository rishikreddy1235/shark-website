        <p>Sharks are a group of elasmobranch fish characterized by a cartilaginous skeleton, five to
            seven gill slits on the sides of the head, and pectoral fins that are not fused to the head. Modern sharks
            are classified within the clade Selachimorpha[1] (or Selachii) and are the sister group to the Batoidea
            (rays and kin). Some sources extend the term "shark" as an informal category including extinct members of
            Chondrichthyes (cartilaginous fish) with a shark-like morphology, such as hybodonts. Shark-like
            chondrichthyans such as Cladoselache and Doliodus first appeared in the Devonian Period (419–359 million
            years), though some fossilized chondrichthyan-like scales are as old as the Late Ordovician (458–444 million
            years ago).[2] The earliest confirmed modern sharks (selachimorphs) are known from the Early Jurassic around
            200 million years ago, with the oldest known member being Agaleus, though records of true sharks may extend
            back as far as the Permian.
